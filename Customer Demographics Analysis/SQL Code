-- I. Business Problem:
/*
In this SQL project, the objective is to conduct a comprehensive cluster analysis of customer demographics and purchasing behavior 
for a specific company. The primary goal is to gain deep insights into the company's ideal customers, enabling the business to better understand their specific needs,
behaviors, and concerns. By analyzing different customer segments,the company can tailor its products and marketing strategies accordingly.
Rather than indiscriminately targeting all customers, the project aims to identify the most dominant customer segments in terms of numbers and spending habits,
optimizing marketing efforts and maximizing sales potential.
*/
-- II. Asking Questions:
/*
1- What are the customer segments that represent the majority of the company's customers in terms of numbers and spending habits? 
2- What are the most popular products for each of these customer segments?
3- What are the preferred shopping medium (web, catalog or store) for the customers of each of these segments?
4- What is the most successful campaign that returned the highest offer acceptance rate among customers of each segment?
5- What is the complaint rate of the customers of these segments?
